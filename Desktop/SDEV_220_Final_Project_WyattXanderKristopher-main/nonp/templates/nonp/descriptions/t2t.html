                <p>The Tunnel to Towers Foundation is a non-profit organization that was established in memory of firefighter Stephen Siller, who lost his life during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The organization's mission is to honor the sacrifice of first responders and military personnel by providing support and assistance to their families. The foundation achieves this through a range of programs and services that provide financial assistance, housing support, and educational resources.<br><br>

                    One of the foundation's most well-known programs is its Smart Home Program, which builds custom-designed homes for severely injured veterans. These homes are equipped with cutting-edge technology and features that allow veterans to live more independently and with greater dignity. The foundation also provides mortgage-free homes to Gold Star families, which are families who have lost a loved one in the line of duty.<br><br>
                    
                    The Tunnel to Towers Foundation also operates a number of other programs and services, including its Fallen First Responder Home Program, which provides mortgage-free homes to the families of first responders who have lost their lives in the line of duty. The foundation also provides financial assistance to families of first responders and military personnel who are experiencing financial hardship. In addition, the foundation operates the Siller Tunnels 5K Run & Walk, an annual event that commemorates Stephen Siller's heroic run through the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel on 9/11. The event raises funds for the foundation's programs and services.
